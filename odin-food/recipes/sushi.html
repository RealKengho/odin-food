  <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>Water</ul>
    <ul>White Rice</ul>
    <ul>Rice Vinegar</ul>
    <ul>White Sugar</ul>
    <ul>Salt</ul>
    <ul>Nori Seaweed</ul>
    <ul>Crabmeat Flaked</ul>
    <ul>Avocado</ul>
    <ul>Cucumber</ul>
    <ul>Picled Ginger</ul>

  <h3>Steps to make</h3>
    <ol>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</ol>
    <ol>Bring water to a boil in a medium pot; stir in rice. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</ol>
    <ol>Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Gently stir into cooked rice in the pot and set aside.</ol>
    <ol>Lay nori sheets on a baking sheet.</ol>
    <ol>Heat nori in the preheated oven until warm, 1 to 2 minutes.</ol>
    <ol>Center 1 nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Use wet hands to spread a thin layer of rice on top. Arrange 1/4 of the crabmeat, avocado, cucumber, and pickled ginger over rice in a line down the center.</ol>
    <ol>Lift one end of the mat and roll it tightly over filling to make a complete roll. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</ol>
    <ol>Use a wet, sharp knife to cut each roll into 4 to 6 slices.</ol>
